      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Theoretical Physicist by background, transitioned into data science as a career. As a theorist, my job was to scribble equations to understand how things work. As part of my Master&amp;rsquo;s thesis, I was working on understand the physics of the very early universe using string theory. For me, Physics and mathematics is never boring, cutting-edge research is very interesting, however I soon realized that a career as a theoretical physicist in academia wasn&amp;rsquo;t for me.</description>
