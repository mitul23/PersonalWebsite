During my learning journey into data science I’ve worked on many different data science projects in python as well in R and SQL. However, I’ve had the most extensive experience in implementing all of my learning skills in the healthcare industry. Working with such large amount of messy health data pushed me to coming up with innovative solutions for doing analysis. 

For the past couple of months, I have mainly worked on
large amount of health data, extracting useful information in the graphical form, applying statistical techniques, developing  predictive models, creating dashboards in R using Shiny, flexdashboard, shinydashboard and producting reports for reproducibility using RMarkdown. 

My main role as a data analyst in healthcare are:
* cleaning/manipulating of health data in Canadian, USA, and UK cohorts, within individuals with autoimmune diseases and psychiatric disorders. 
* Create predictive models such as logistic regression, based on the insightful analysis. Implement PCA on high dimensional data.
* Stays up-to-date with research in the field by reading new/recent journal articles related to the research.

I'm a data-lover and would like to explore some interesting fields. This website will host my learning experience as well to store all my code in one place.
